## Setup
### Prerequisites
```
*	This is for those with intermediate JavaScript experience.
*	A basic knowledge of Node.js and the Command-line. 
```
### Installing
```
Clone this repo to your desktop.
```

The relevant JavaScript files:
1.	__Index.js__: The file containing the main logic of the game, which depends on _Word.js_ and:
    * Randomly selects a word and uses the Word constructor to store it,
    * Prompts the user for each guess and keeps track of the user's remaining guesses,
2. __Word.js__: Contains a constructor, _Word_ that depends on the Letter constructor. This is used to create an object representing the current word the user is attempting to guess.
3. __Letter.js__: Contains a constructor, _Letter_. This constructor displays an underlying character or a blank placeholder, depending on whether or not the user has guessed the letter.

```
Install Node Packages:
